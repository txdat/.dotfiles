# /review-feature — Review Feature Plan

If `skip approval` context — auto-apply changes, auto-create sub-issues.

Do NOT write code.

Find plan from $ARGUMENTS or by status `planning`/`approved`/`blocked-by-architecture`. If unfamiliar areas, suggest the explore skill.

Read plan + project config file (CLAUDE.md/CODEX.md/GEMINI.md/AGENTS.md).

## Review

- **Requirement**: clear, measurable done
- **Scope**: in/out explicit
- **Design**: alternatives + reasoning
- **Risks**: actionable mitigations
- **Steps**: 5–10 Implementation Steps, dependency-ordered. >10 → `❌` propose split
- **PR Pattern**: present; `Steps` partitions all Implementation Steps (each step in exactly one slice) AND no TC spans slices (every step satisfying a TC is in the same slice → each slice independently green). Gap, overlap, or TC-spanning slice → `❌` (breaks chain execution)

**Split accepted**: new files per sub-plan. If `Issue:` set, ask: "Create sub-issues?"

Flag: undefined terms, missing constraints, edge cases, assumptions. One follow-up max.

**TDD (blocking)**:
- Test Cases non-empty and listed before Implementation Steps.
- Each TC has all four fields (Given/When/Then/Verifies) filled.
- Bidirectional refs: every Impl → ≥1 TC-N; every TC → ≥1 Impl. Orphan TC or unreferenced Impl → `❌`.
- Feature/fix: TCs describe new behavior (will fail until implemented).
- Refactor: TCs pin existing behavior (must pass before and after).

## Output

- Verdict: READY | NEEDS CHANGES
- ❌ Blocking: N
- ⚠️ Suggestions: N
- `<path>`

Ask: "Apply?" If `planning` or `blocked-by-architecture` + resolved → `approved`. Print: "Plan approved. Run the execute-feature skill."
