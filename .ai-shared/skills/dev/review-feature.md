# /review-feature — Review Feature Plan

Do NOT write code.

**Owns:** the WHAT and HOW. Design is still OPEN here — this is the last gate to change direction. Step back to the system level; do not just validate the document's fields.

Find plan from $ARGUMENTS or by status `planning`/`approved`/`blocked-by-architecture`. If unfamiliar areas, suggest the explore skill.

Read plan + project config file (CLAUDE.md/CODEX.md/GEMINI.md/AGENTS.md).

## Precondition (blocking)

`## Assumptions & Open Questions` → Open Questions MUST be empty. Any unresolved → STOP, verdict NEEDS CHANGES, route back to design-feature. Never review an under-specified plan.

## Systemic Review

Step back from the document to the system:

- **Approach**: is this the simplest correct solution? Are the Design Decisions' alternatives credible, or does a better one exist? Challenge the choice — don't ratify it.
- **System fit**: read the plan's `## Context` and Affected Components to ground this — interactions with existing components, shared contracts, and boundaries; backward compatibility; cross-service deployment & migration ordering (PR Pattern must honor `## Context` Dependencies); blast radius; rollback. If `blocked-by-architecture`, read its source `docs/architecture/` doc and verify the plan honors that doc's `Contracts:` — violation → `❌`.
- **Completeness**: missing error modes, concurrency, scale, security, observability, edge cases.
- **Assumptions**: challenge each in `## Assumptions & Open Questions`; an unsound assumption → `❌`.

## Structural Review

- **Requirement**: clear, measurable done
- **Scope**: in/out explicit
- **Non-functional**: `### Non-functional` answered; each code-requiring item maps to an Implementation Step (or marked `ops-only`). Unmapped → `❌`
- **Risks**: actionable mitigations
- **Steps**: 5–10 Implementation Steps, dependency-ordered. >10 → `❌` propose split
- **PR Pattern**: present; `Steps` partitions all Implementation Steps (each step in exactly one slice) AND no TC spans slices (every step satisfying a TC is in the same slice → each slice independently green). Gap, overlap, or TC-spanning slice → `❌` (breaks chain execution)

**Split accepted**: new files per sub-plan. If `Issue:` set, ask: "Create sub-issues?"

Flag undefined terms inline. One follow-up max.

**TDD (blocking)**:
- Test Cases non-empty and listed before Implementation Steps.
- Each TC has all four fields (Given/When/Then/Verifies) filled.
- Bidirectional refs: every Impl → ≥1 TC-N; every TC → ≥1 Impl. Orphan TC or unreferenced Impl → `❌`.
- Feature/fix: TCs describe new behavior (will fail until implemented).
- Refactor: TCs pin existing behavior (must pass before and after).

## Output

```
## Plan Review Report
### Summary
(2–3 sentences: approach soundness, system risk, verdict rationale)
### ❌ Blocking (N)
- <section> — issue — why it breaks
### ⚠️ Suggestions (N)
- <section> — improvement
### Verdict: READY | NEEDS CHANGES — `<path>`
```

- **NEEDS CHANGES** (any ❌): offer to apply blocking fixes to the plan (wait for approval); design-level rethink → route back to design-feature. Status unchanged until cleared.
- **READY**: ask "Apply suggestions?"; on apply or skip → `planning`/`blocked-by-architecture` (resolved) become `approved`. Print: "Plan approved. Run the execute-feature skill."
