# Dev Skills

## Hierarchy

```
/design-system    → architecture, cross-cutting patterns
    ↓ decomposes to
/design-feature   → feature/fix/refactor implementation
    ↓ may require
/design-infra     → infrastructure config (terraform, k8s)
```

## Full Feature Cycle

`/dev:ship-feature <requirement>` — explore → design-feature → review-feature → execute → review-code → recap → PR

Resume: `/dev:ship-feature add-jwt from execute`

Plan review enforces the open-questions gate: if `design-feature` saves a draft with unresolved `Open Questions:`, `review-feature` stops and routes back to planning.

**Manual approval.** `review-feature` never sets `approved` — on verdict READY it leaves the plan `planning` and tells you to approve it manually (set `Status: approved`). The implementing skills (`execute-feature`, `execute-infra`, and `fix-bug` when a plan is active) verify `approved` before touching files. `ship-feature` is the *sole* auto-approver: inside the full cycle it sets `approved` itself once review-feature returns READY.

**Session-pinned active plan.** Each session has one active plan. Establish it by naming an existing plan (`docs/plans/<file>.md` or its slug) in the skill args, or by running `design-feature` (the new plan is adopted on the next gated skill). It is then reused for the rest of the session; naming a different plan re-pins. With 0 or 2+ active plans and none named, gated skills STOP and ask which.

Every dev skill ends with a blocking self-check. Do not emit the skill's handoff line until that checklist is verified against the artifacts.
